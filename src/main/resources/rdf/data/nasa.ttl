i spent about 10 years working at the ames research center, and during that time i had 
an enormous amount of fun.  i learned important lessons, such as:

* there is a great deal to know about the world, and i can expect to capture only a thin sliver of it all.
* it is better to listen with my ears, rather than my mouth.

expand this node to see details about my work at ames.
